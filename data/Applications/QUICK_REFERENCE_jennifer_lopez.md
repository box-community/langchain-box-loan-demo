## 📊 CRITICAL DTI CALCULATION

```
Current Debt: $1,100/month
Income: $3,200/month
Current DTI: $1,100 / $3,200 = 34.4% ⚠️

Proposed Payment: $650/month
New Total Debt: $1,100 + $650 = $1,750/month
New DTI: $1,750 / $3,200 = 54.7% 🚫

EXCEEDED MAXIMUM BY: 54.7% - 43% = 11.7%
```

**This DTI is catastrophically high - borrower cannot afford loan**

## 🚨 WHY AUTOMATIC DENIAL

### Multiple Major Violations = Auto-Deny
**System Logic:**
- 1 Major violation → Possible decline
- 2 Major violations → Likely decline
- **3+ Major violations → AUTOMATIC DENIAL**

**Jennifer has 2 MAJOR + 1 MINOR + Multiple Disqualifying Factors**

### The Math Doesn't Work
```
Income: $3,200/month
Existing Debt: -$1,100 (34% of income)
Proposed Payment: -$650 (20% of income)
Remaining: $1,450 (45% of income)

Living expenses (conservative): $1,800/month
- Rent: $900
- Food: $400
- Utilities: $200
- Gas: $150
- Phone: $80
- Other: $70

SHORTFALL: -$350/month
```

**Borrower literally cannot afford this loan**

## 🚫 DECISION MATRIX

### Can Standard Underwriter Approve? ❌ NO
- **Reason:** Multiple major violations
- **Action:** System auto-denies before reaching underwriter

### Can Senior Underwriter Approve? ❌ NO
- **Reason:** Credit below minimum, recent repo
- **Action:** Disqualifying factors present

### Can Regional Director Approve? ❌ NO
- **Reason:** Multiple disqualifying events
- **Action:** No authority to override these issues

### Can Executive Approve? ❌ SHOULDN'T
- **Reason:** Catastrophic risk profile
- **Recommendation:** Decline is the only responsible decision
- **Exception:** Only if portfolio needs ultra-high-risk loans priced at 35-40% APR

---

## 💡 WHY THIS IS AUTO-DENY

### 1. Credit Score Far Below Minimum
- 575 vs 620 minimum = 45 points gap
- No "gray area" - clearly unqualified
- Recent history worsening, not improving

### 2. DTI Far Over Maximum
- 54.7% vs 43% maximum = 11.7 points over
- Borrower literally cannot afford payment
- No amount of compensating factors help

### 3. Recent Auto Repossession
- Only 18 months ago
- Same type of loan being requested
- Strong predictor of repeat behavior

### 4. Active Collections Unpaid
- $3,245 in collections ignored
- Shows unwillingness or inability to pay debts
- Collections growing, not shrinking

### 5. Current Financial Crisis
- 3 payday loans = desperation
- 2 accounts currently late
- 92% credit utilization
- No emergency reserves

### 6. Unstable Employment
- 6 months current job
- Pattern of 4-6 month positions
- Multiple gaps in past 2 years
- Income highly variable
