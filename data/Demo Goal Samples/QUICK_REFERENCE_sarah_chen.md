## 🧮 CALCULATION VERIFICATION

**DTI Calculation:**
```
Total Monthly Debt = $400 (existing) + $510 (proposed) = $910
Monthly Income = $7,500
DTI = $910 / $7,500 = 12.13%
Result: PASS (well below 43% threshold)
```

**LTV Calculation:**
```
Loan Amount = $27,000
Vehicle Value = $30,000
LTV = $27,000 / $30,000 = 90%
Result: PASS (within acceptable range)
```

**Payment-to-Income:**
```
Proposed Payment = $510
Monthly Income = $7,500
PTI = $510 / $7,500 = 6.8%
Result: EXCELLENT (very affordable)
```
